Time Complexity
Graph Construction: 
O(V+E)O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

Priority Queue Operations: Each vertex is inserted and extracted once, so 
O(V log V)O(VlogV). For each edge, the heapq.heappush or update operation takes 
O(logV)O(logV), giving O(ElogV) O(ElogV).

Overall Complexity: 
O((V+E)logV)
Space Complexity
Adjacency List Representation: 
O(V+E)
Priority Queue: 
O(V)
Distance and Predecessor Dictionaries: 
O(V)
Total Space Complexity: 
O(V+E)
